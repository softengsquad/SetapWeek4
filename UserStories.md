## User Story
*“We shall be developing a music streaming app that will play music based on the current weather if so desired, Weather BeatZ. We believe that there is a gap in the market for a particular sort of music application. Most music streaming apps are content with allowing the user to sort through their songs based on most listened to tracks, suggested genres, popular top charted music, and music in rotation within their playlists. We have thought of allowing users to access a music application that gives them the ability to listen to music based on the current state of the weather. With the implementation of weather, we could allow the music to enhance the mood of the user, and the weather to give more vibrance to the music; thus both complementing each other and the sound and imagery the user would be experiencing.” (Team 9A, 2019)*

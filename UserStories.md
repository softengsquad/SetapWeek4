# Software Engineering and Practice Week 4

## User Story
*“We shall be developing a music streaming app that will play music based on the current weather if so desired, Weather BeatZ. We believe that there is a gap in the market for a particular sort of music application. Most music streaming apps are content with allowing the user to sort through their songs based on most listened to tracks, suggested genres, popular top charted music, and music in rotation within their playlists. We have thought of allowing users to access a music application that gives them the ability to listen to music based on the current state of the weather. With the implementation of weather, we could allow the music to enhance the mood of the user, and the weather to give more vibrance to the music; thus both complementing each other and the sound and imagery the user would be experiencing.” (Team 9A, 2019)*


## Questions
1. What type of songs relate to which weathers? (is a sad song always relating to rain...)
2. Will the user be able to customise their music for each type of weather?
3. Which devices will be used?
4. How often should the weather state be updated?
5. How will the Language of the music be determined?
6. How would music be ranked for each type of weather? (most amount of listens or most fitting)
7. What would happen if one song fits multiple types of weather? (should it be present in both?)
8. Would you used the app on multiple devices at the same time?


## User Stories for Interview
1. Don't pick songs specifically. Select genres for a certain weather and generate multiple songs for that genre. Give the ability to remove songs when needed.
2. -
3. Used on mobile devices, when going to work (make it accessible to all)
4. Every 30 minutes the weather will be updated. Maybe update it more when in an area with more variable climates
5. -
6. -
7. -
8. One device at a time. As simple a user interface as possible.
